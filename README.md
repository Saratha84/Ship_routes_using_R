🌍 Shipping Lanes Meet Night Lights in South Asia


Inspired by the brilliant tutorial from Milos Makes Maps, I recreated and extended his visualization for the South Asian region — where the ocean isn’t just water, it’s infrastructure.

🛳️ Shipping traffic + 🌃 Nighttime lights = a powerful view into how maritime transportation powers the economies of India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Southeast Asia.

🔶 Bright yellow nightlights reveal economic activity on land

🔷 Cool blue corridors show ship density along key trade routes

📌 From the Strait of Malacca to the Bay of Bengal, this region is a hive of global commerce.


🧰 Made in R using terra, sf, ggplot2, and ggnewscale

 🎨 Color palette tweaked to highlight high-traffic lanes + urban energy use

💬 Why it matters:

 South Asia’s coastal cities depend heavily on maritime trade — and this visualization makes that connection tangible.

🔁 Inspired by open-source tools and tutorials — big thanks to Milos Popovic, PhD for sharing knowledge!
